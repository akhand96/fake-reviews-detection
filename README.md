# fake-reviews-detection
This repository explores and compares various machine learning techniques for detecting fake reviews. It conducts a comparative study of four well-known machine learning models: Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) using the Fake Reviews Dataset from Salminen.
